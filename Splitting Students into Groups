In the journal, the names and surnames of the students are written in a column. The students were divided into 2 equal groups for English lessons.
If it is not possible to divide equally, then in the second group you can do one more student.
Given a number N, then N names of students. 
Output two arrays: with the names of the students from the first group and the names from the second (in the same order as they were in the general list)

# Enter the number of students  
n = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))

# Enter student names
names = []
for i in range(n):
    name = input("Enter student name: ")
    names.append(name)

# Divide students into two groups
group1 = names[:n // 2]
group2 = names[n // 2:]

# If the number of students is odd, add one student to the second group
if n % 2 == 1:
    group2.append(names[-1])

# Print the names of the students in the two groups
print("Students in the first group:")
for name in group1:
    print(name)

print("Students in the second group:")
for name in group2:
    print(name)
